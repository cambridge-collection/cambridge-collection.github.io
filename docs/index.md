# Cambridge Digital Collection Platform Documentation

Welcome to the code repository for Cambridge Digital Collection Platform. 

This houses the code for projects developed by the teams at the Cambridge University Library including
Cambridge Digital Collection Platform which underpins the [Cambridge Digital Library](https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk),  
[Manchester Digital Collections](https://www.digitalcollections.manchester.ac.uk/),
among others. It is a platform that takes source metadata and images and 
provides a system for processing these into a website for display and discovery, 
with [IIIF](https://iiif.io) capability.

These documents are constantly being updated and reviewed. 
At the moment they are fairly minimal, but we are 
planning on adding to them, and welcome any contributions both to the code and to the documentation.

## What are all these repositories for?

Take a look at the
[architecture overview](arch-overview.md)
which shows the role of the different repositories and how they are connected. 

## Where do I get started?

First take a look at our guide to [setting up a local viewer version](setup-local-viewer.md) using docker-compose. 
This will get a local version of the platform on your local machine.

## Contributions
